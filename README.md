Lak is a 40-key macro ~~pad~~ board

The stl files in this repo, with the rest of the physical components outlined in the bill of materials, can be used to create a 40-key programmable macroboard.

Lak is a hand-wired keyboard project powered by a [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano) V1 and [ZMK](https://zmk.dev).
The shield config, keymap, and a prebuilt uf2 can be found [here](https://github.com/BrokenFlows/zmk-brokenflows).

## Instructions

The following instructions will provide details on how to assemble the project as well as covering the materials required.
The project requires some readily available keyboard components, some custom 3D printed components, and a nice!nano microcontroller which (at the time of writing) is available at somewhat frequent but irregular intervals.

### Hardware

The [tools](#Tools) and [materials](#Bill-of-Materials) will be used to assemble the final product, shown above. Once you have acquired the items required, you can follow the steps outlined in the [assembly](#Pre-Wiring) section.

#### Tools
- Soldering Iron
- Solder Wire
- 3D Printer/ 3D Printing Service/ or some means of mimicking [the case and parts](./stls/) listed below
- Scissors/ wire cutter
- Glue/ Hot Glue Gun
- **Optional:** wire stripper

The above BoM lists uniform profile keycaps and links to relegendable keycaps. I used a mixture of both of the following in my build:
- [Relgendable MX-Style Keycaps](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5039)
- [DSA Blank Keycaps](https://kbdfans.com/collections/dsa-profile/products/dsa-blank-keycaps-1u-10pcs)

If mixing and matching, or just getting one set, be sure to have 40 keycaps available for your build.

#### 3D Printing
I recommend 3D printing the stl files at the following settings:
Setting         | Value
:---------------|-----:
Filament        | PLA
Nozzle Diameter | < 0.4 mm
Layer Height    | < 0.2 mm
Infill          | 20% <
Supports        | On

#### Pre-Wiring
1. Insert the 40 switches into the case â€” the top of the switches should be on the shorter side relative to the plate.
2. At this point the keycaps can be placed on top of the switches. If using relegendable keycaps, insert the paper legends before placing the keycaps.
3. Place the nice!nano in its sled housing.

#### Wiring
Bend the legs of a diode so that it can hook onto a switch pin and the leg can continue along the row of keys, as seen in the following picture.

![Picture showing a diode hooked onto a switch pin with one leg while the other leg carries on towards the next switch](./images/lak_hand_wiring1.jpeg)

At this point solder the diode to the switch pin. Then prepare another diode the same way at the next switch over.

![Picture showing two diodes hooked onto switch pins with one leg while the other leg carries on towards the next switches](./images/lak_hand_wiring2.jpeg)

Once both switches are soldered to the switch pins, solder the diode legs together along the row where the legs meet.

Carry on, repeating this process until there is one diode connected to each switch and all diodes in a row are connected also.

This completes the rows of the matrix. 

Next we connect the columns of the matrix with lengths of wire.
This can be done with three wires per column, one between each pair of switch pins, or with one long wire stripped where it passes the switch pins.

![Picture showing a wire connecting switches in one column together by the remaining pins on the switches](./images/lak_hand_wiring4.jpeg)

Solder the wire in place where it passes each pin.
Whether using three wires or one length with stripped sections, there should be four solder joint per column.

This completes the columns of the matrix, and therefore the entire switch matrix.
