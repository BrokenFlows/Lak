Lak is a 40-key macro ~~pad~~ board

The stl files in this repo, with the rest of the physical components outlined in the bill of materials, can be used to create a 40-key programmable macroboard.

Lak is a hand-wired keyboard project powered by a [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano) V1 and [ZMK](https://zmk.dev).
The shield config, keymap, and a prebuilt uf2 can be found [here](https://github.com/BrokenFlows/zmk-brokenflows).
